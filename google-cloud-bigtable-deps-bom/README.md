# Dependency BOM for Google Cloud Bigtable Client

This module contains a BOM that lists all of Cloud Bigtable's dependency versions. Please note that
this BOM is complementary to google-cloud-bigtable-bom. This BOM only contains transitive dependencies,
while google-cloud-bigtable-bom contains versions for direct google-cloud-bigtable artifacts.

This BOM is primarily intended to be used by java-bigtable-hbase to keep the dependencies in sync.
