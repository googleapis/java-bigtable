/**
 * A set of SQL data, generated as the result of an ExecuteQuery request.
 *
 * <p>This allows access to the data of one row at a time using the methods from the {@code
 * StructReader} interface. The rows are read in the order of the query results. To advance to the
 * next row call {@link #next}. This returns {@code false} once all the rows have been iterated
 * over. The result set is initially positioned before the first row, so {@link #next} must be
 * called before reading any data.
 *
 * <p>{@link #getMetadata()} may be called before calling next. It will block until the metadata has
 * been received.
 *
 * <p>{@code ResultSet} implementations may buffer data ahead and/or maintain a persistent streaming
 * connection to the remote service until all data has been returned or the resultSet closed. As
 * such, it is important that all uses of {@code ResultSet} either fully consume it (that is, call
 * {@code next()} until {@code false} is returned or it throws an exception) or explicitly call
 * {@link #close()}: failure to do so may result in wasted work or leaked resources.
 *
 * <p>{@code ResultSet} implementations are not required to be thread-safe: the thread that asked
 * for a ResultSet must be the one that interacts with it.
